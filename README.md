**Warning right here:** This project is untested and in what can only be described as pre-alpha. Use is at your own discretion.

This is a dashboard showing squares with an arbitrary label. Clicking a square toggles them between red and green. All connected clients will see this change immediately. That's it. If you can find a use case for this, I'd love to hear about it.
